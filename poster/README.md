# Interactive Poster for CHVRCHES

## Building the project

1. First ensure that `npm` is installed.
2. Next run `npm install` while at the project root (the same level as this file)
3. Lastly run `npm run build` and check for the built page in the `dist/` folder

This project utilizes Gulp in order to compile the Sass styles and minimize the final code.
